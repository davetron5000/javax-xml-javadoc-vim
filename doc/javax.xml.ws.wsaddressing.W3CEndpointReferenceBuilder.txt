*javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder_Description*

This class is used to build W3CEndpointReference instances. The intended use of this clsss is for an application component, for 
example a factory component, to create an W3CEndpointReference for a web service endpoint published by the same Java EE 
application. It can also be used to create W3CEndpointReferences for an Java SE based endpoint by providing the address 
property. 

When creating a W3CEndpointReference for an endpoint that is not published by the same Java EE application, the address 
property MUST be specified. 

When creating a W3CEndpointReference for an endpoint published by the same Java EE application, the address property MAY be 
null but then the serviceName and endpointName MUST specify an endpoint published by the same Java EE application. 

When the wsdlDocumentLocation is specified it MUST refer to a valid WSDL document and the serviceName and endpointName (if 
specified) MUST match a service and port in the WSDL document. 



*javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder()*

public W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder()

Creates a new W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder instance. 


*javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder.address(String)*

public |javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder| address(java.lang.String address)

Sets the address to the W3CEndpointReference instance's wsa:Address. 

The address MUST be set to a non-null value when building a W3CEndpointReference for a web service endpoint that is not 
published by the same Java EE application or when running on Java SE. 


    address - The address of the endpoint to be targeted by the returned W3CEndpointReference. 

    Returns: A W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder instance with the address set to the wsa:Address. 

*javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder.build()*

public |javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReference| build()

Builds a W3CEndpointReference from the accumulated properties set on this W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder instance. 

This method can be used to create a W3CEndpointReference for any endpoint by specifying the address property along with any 
other desired properties. This method can also be used to create a W3CEndpointReference for an endpoint that is published by 
the same Java EE application. This method can automatically determine the address of an endpoint published by the same Java EE 
application that is identified by the serviceName and endpointName properties. If the address is null and the serviceName and 
endpointName do not identify an endpoint published by the same Java EE application, a java.lang.IllegalStateException MUST be 
thrown. 



    Returns: W3CEndpointReference from the accumulated properties set on this W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder instance. This method never 
             returns null. 

*javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder.endpointName(QName)*

public |javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder| endpointName(javax.xml.namespace.QName endpointName)

Sets the endpointName of the endpoint to be targeted by the returned W3CEndpointRefernce. This method can only be called after 
the (|javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder|) method has been called. 


    endpointName - The name of the endpoint to be targeted by the returned W3CEndpointReference. The endpointName (portName) property may also be 
       used with the serviceName property to lookup the address of a web service endpoint published by the same Java EE 
       application. 

    Returns: A W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder instance with the endpointName property set. 

*javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder.metadata(Element)*

public |javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder| metadata(org.w3c.dom.Element metadataElement)

Adds the metadataElement to the W3CEndpointReference instance's wsa:Metadata element. 


    metadataElement - The element to be added to the wsa:Metadata element. 

    Returns: A W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder instance with the metadataElement added to the wsa:Metadata element. 

*javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder.referenceParameter(Element)*

public |javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder| referenceParameter(org.w3c.dom.Element referenceParameter)

Adds the referenceParameter to the W3CEndpointReference instance wsa:ReferenceParameters element. 


    referenceParameter - The element to be added to the wsa:ReferenceParameters element. 

    Returns: A W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder instance with the referenceParameter added to the wsa:ReferenceParameters element. 

*javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder.serviceName(QName)*

public |javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder| serviceName(javax.xml.namespace.QName serviceName)

Sets the serviceName of the endpoint to be targeted by the returned W3CEndpointReference. 


    serviceName - The service name of the endpoint to be targeted by the returned W3CEndpointReference. This property may also be used with the 
       endpointName (portName) property to lookup the address of a web service endpoint that is published by the same Java EE 
       application. 

    Returns: A W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder instance with the serviceName property set. 

*javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder.wsdlDocumentLocation(String)*

public |javax.xml.ws.wsaddressing.W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder| wsdlDocumentLocation(java.lang.String wsdlDocumentLocation)

Sets the wsdlDocumentLocation associated with the targeted W3CEndpointReference. 


    wsdlDocumentLocation - The location of the WSDL document associated with the targeted W3CEndpointReference. 

    Returns: A W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder instance with the wsdlDocumentLocation property set.
