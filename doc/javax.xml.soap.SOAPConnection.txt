*javax.xml.soap.SOAPConnection_Description*

A point-to-point connection that a client can use for sending messages directly to a remote party (represented by a URL, for 
instance). 

The SOAPConnection class is optional. Some implementations may not implement this interface in which case the call to 
SOAPConnectionFactory.newInstance() (see below) will throw an UnsupportedOperationException. 

A client can obtain a SOAPConnection object using a (|javax.xml.soap.SOAPConnectionFactory|) object as in the following 
example: 

SOAPConnectionFactory factory = SOAPConnectionFactory.newInstance(); SOAPConnection con = factory.createConnection(); 

A SOAPConnection object can be used to send messages directly to a URL following the request/response paradigm. That is, 
messages are sent using the method call, which sends the message and then waits until it gets a reply.

public abstract |javax.xml.soap.SOAPMessage| call(

  throws |javax.xml.soap.SOAPException|
         
Sends the given message to the specified endpoint and blocks until it has returned the response. 


    request - the SOAPMessage object to be sent 
    to - an Object that identifies where the message should be sent. It is required to support Objects of type java.lang.String, 
       java.net.URL, and when JAXM is present javax.xml.messaging.URLEndpoint 

    Returns: the SOAPMessage object that is the response to the message that was sent 

*javax.xml.soap.SOAPConnection.close()*

public abstract void close()
  throws |javax.xml.soap.SOAPException|
         
Closes this SOAPConnection object.

  throws |javax.xml.soap.SOAPException|
         
Gets a message from a specific endpoint and blocks until it receives, 


    to - an Object that identifies where the request should be sent. Objects of type java.lang.String and java.net.URL must be 
       supported. 

    Returns: the SOAPMessage object that is the response to the get message request
