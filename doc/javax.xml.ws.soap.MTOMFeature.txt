*javax.xml.ws.soap.MTOMFeature_Description*

This feature represents the use of MTOM with a web service. 

The following describes the affects of this feature with respect to being enabled or disabled: 

ENABLED: In this Mode, MTOM will be enabled. DISABLED: In this Mode, MTOM will be disabled 

The (|javax.xml.ws.soap.MTOMFeature|) property can be used to set the threshold value used to determine when binary data should 
be XOP encoded. 



*java.lang.String_javax.xml.ws.soap.MTOMFeature.ID*

Constant value identifying the MTOMFeature 


*int_javax.xml.ws.soap.MTOMFeature.threshold*

Property for MTOM threshold value. This property serves as a hint when MTOM is enabled, binary data above this size in bytes 
SHOULD be sent as attachment. The value of this property MUST always be >= 0. Default value is 0. 



*javax.xml.ws.soap.MTOMFeature()*

public MTOMFeature()

Create an MTOMFeature. The instance created will be enabled. 


*javax.xml.ws.soap.MTOMFeature(boolean)*

public MTOMFeature(boolean enabled)

Creates an MTOMFeature. 

    enabled - specifies if this feature should be enabled or not 

*javax.xml.ws.soap.MTOMFeature(boolean,int)*

public MTOMFeature(
  boolean enabled,
  int threshold)

Creates an MTOMFeature. 

    enabled - specifies if this feature should be enabled or not 
    threshold - the size in bytes that binary data SHOULD be before being sent as an attachment. 

*javax.xml.ws.soap.MTOMFeature(int)*

public MTOMFeature(int threshold)

Creates an MTOMFeature. The instance created will be enabled. 

    threshold - the size in bytes that binary data SHOULD be before being sent as an attachment. 

*javax.xml.ws.soap.MTOMFeature.getID()*

public |java.lang.String| getID()





*javax.xml.ws.soap.MTOMFeature.getThreshold()*

public int getThreshold()

Gets the threshold value used to determine when binary data should be sent as an attachment. 



    Returns: the current threshold size in bytes
