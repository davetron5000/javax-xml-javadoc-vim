*javax.xml.ws.spi.WebServiceFeatureAnnotation_Description*

Annotation used to identify other annotations as a WebServiceFeature. 

Each WebServiceFeature annotation annotated with this annotation MUST contain an enabled property of type boolean with a 
default value of true. JAX-WS defines the following WebServiceFeature annotations (Addressing, MTOM, RespectBinding), however, 
an implementation may define vendors specific annotations for other features. If a JAX-WS implementation encounters an 
annotation annotated with the WebServiceFeatureAnnotation that it does not recognize/support an error MUST be given.
