*javax.xml.stream.events.Characters_Description*

This describes the interface to Characters events. All text events get reported as Characters events. Content, CData and 
whitespace are all reported as Characters events. IgnorableWhitespace, in most cases, will be set to false unless an element 
declaration of element content is present for the current element. 



*javax.xml.stream.events.Characters.getData()*

public |java.lang.String| getData()

Get the character data of this event 



*javax.xml.stream.events.Characters.isCData()*

public boolean isCData()

Returns true if this is a CData section. If this event is CData its event type will be CDATA 

If javax.xml.stream.isCoalescing is set to true CDATA Sections that are surrounded by non CDATA characters will be reported as 
a single Characters event. This method will return false in this case. 



*javax.xml.stream.events.Characters.isIgnorableWhiteSpace()*

public boolean isIgnorableWhiteSpace()

Return true if this is ignorableWhiteSpace. If this event is ignorableWhiteSpace its event type will be SPACE. 



*javax.xml.stream.events.Characters.isWhiteSpace()*

public boolean isWhiteSpace()
