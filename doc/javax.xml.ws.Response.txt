For asynchronous operation invocations it provides additional methods to check the status of the request. The get(...) methods 
may throw the standard set of exceptions and their cause may be a RemoteException or a (|javax.xml.ws.WebServiceException|) 
that represents the error that occured during the asynchronous method invocation.
