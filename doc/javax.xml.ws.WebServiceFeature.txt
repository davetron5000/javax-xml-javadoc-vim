*javax.xml.ws.WebServiceFeature_Description*

A WebServiceFeature is used to represent a feature that can be enabled or disabled for a web service. 

The JAX-WS specification will define some standard features and JAX-WS implementors are free to define additional features if 
necessary. Vendor specific features may not be portable so caution should be used when using them. Each Feature definition MUST 
define a public static final String ID that can be used in the Feature annotation to refer to the feature. This ID MUST be 
unique across all features of all vendors. When defining a vendor specific feature ID, use a vendor specific namespace in the 
ID string.
