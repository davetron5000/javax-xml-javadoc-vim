*javax.xml.ws.RespectBindingFeature_Description*

This feature clarifies the use of the wsdl:binding in a JAX-WS runtime. 

This feature is only useful with web services that have an associated WSDL. Enabling this feature requires that a JAX-WS 
implementation inspect the wsdl:binding for an endpoint at runtime to make sure that all wsdl:extensions that have the required 
attribute set to true are understood and are being used. 

The following describes the affects of this feature with respect to be enabled or disabled: 

ENABLED: In this Mode, a JAX-WS runtime MUST assure that all required wsdl:binding extensions are either understood and used by 
the runtime, or explicitly disabled by the web service application. A web service application can disable a particular 
extension that has a known WebServiceFeature using either the appropriate annotation associated with that WebServiceFeature on 
the server, or one of the following methods on the client: 

(|javax.xml.ws.Service|) (|javax.xml.ws.Service|) (|javax.xml.ws.Service|) (|javax.xml.ws.Service|) (|javax.xml.ws.Service|) 
(|javax.xml.ws.Service|) (|javax.xml.ws.Service|) (|javax.xml.ws.EndpointReference|) One of the 
getXXXPort(WebServiceFeatures...) methods on a generated Service. 

The runtime MUST also make sure that binding of SEI parameters/return values respect the wsdl:binding. With this feature 
enabled, if a required (wsdl:required="true") wsdl:binding extension is in the WSDL and it is not supported by a JAX-WS runtime 
and it has not been explicitly turned off by the web service developer, then that JAX-WS runtime MUST behave appropriately 
based on whether it is on the client or server: 

Client: runtime MUST throw a WebServiceException no sooner than when one of the methods above is invoked but no later than the 
first invocation of an endpoint operation. Server: throw a WebServiceException and the endpoint MUST fail to deploy 

DISABLED: In this Mode, an implementation may choose whether to inspect the wsdl:binding or not and to what degree the 
wsdl:binding will be inspected. For example, one implementation may choose to behave as if this feature is enabled, another 
implementation may only choose to verify the SEI's parameter/return type bindings.
