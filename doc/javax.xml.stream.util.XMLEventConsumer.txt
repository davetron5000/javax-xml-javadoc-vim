|javax.xml.stream.util.XMLEventConsumer.add(XMLEvent)|This method adds an event to the consumer.

*javax.xml.stream.util.XMLEventConsumer_Description*

This interface defines an event consumer interface. The contract of the of a consumer is to accept the event. This interface 
can be used to mark an object as able to receive events. Add may be called several times in immediate succession so a consumer 
must be able to cache events it hasn't processed yet. 



*javax.xml.stream.util.XMLEventConsumer.add(XMLEvent)*

public void add(javax.xml.stream.events.XMLEvent event)
  throws |javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException|
         
This method adds an event to the consumer. Calling this method invalidates the event parameter. The client application should 
discard all references to this event upon calling add. The behavior of an application that continues to use such references is 
undefined. 


    event - the event to add, may not be null
